== Build & Install

=== Dependencies

1. wlr-glew-renderer +
See https://github.com/zigen-project/wlr-glew-renderer[github.com/zigen-project/wlr-glew-renderer] to build and install.
2. tomlc99 +
See https://github.com/cktan/tomlc99[cktan/tomlc99] to build and install. +
Note that `make install` tries to install `libtoml.pc` to `/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig`. You need to rename `libtoml.pc.sample` in the tomlc99 project root to `libtoml.pc` and manually create `/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig` before runnning `make install`.
3. Other dependencies +
For Ubuntu, other dependencies can be installed with `apt-get`. See `.github/workflows/test.yaml` for the list of the required packages.
